## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The main steps for running a full experiment are as follows:

1. **Initial training on random reaches**  
   Run `setup_OFC_network.py` to train the model on a synthetic random reach dataset.  
   â†’ [Code](setup_OFC_network.py)

2. **Adaptation to visuomotor rotation (VR) perturbation**  
   Run `adaptation_learning.py` to simulate fast adaptation using a feedback-driven plasticity rule.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

The original experiments were run using:

- Python 3.7.4  
- PyTorch 1.8.1
